Commercial License Agreement


This document serves as License Agreement between ‘Videobolt d.o.o.’ the author of the item (‘Designer’, or ‘Author’) and the person to whom it was issued (‘Owner’). This License Agreement determines the rules of proper use and distribution of video files created with Videobolt (any such file, a ‘Video’, or collectively, ‘Videos’). This license applies to Videos sold with the Commercial License.

II A Commercial License allows the creation of a number of videos, determined by the purchased plan, containing the Video, in part or entirety (any such video, a ‘Product’, or collectively, ‘Products’). Products may be used for any purpose, including digital advertising, TV commercials and broadcasts. Products are intended for use by the legal person to whom the license was issued or transferred. A Product cannot be sold and this license transferred. This License Agreement does not contain a Resale clause, therefore reselling the Product or transferring the License is considered a License Infringement and may be persecuted.

III You can only use the Product for lawful purposes. Also, if a product contains an image of a person, even if the product is model-released you can’t use it in a way that creates a fake identity, implies personal endorsement of a product by the person, or in a way that is defamatory, obscene or demeaning, or in connection with sensitive subjects.

IV This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

V You can’t use the Product in a logo, trademark, or service mark.

VI You can modify or manipulate the Product. You can combine the Product with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 3.
